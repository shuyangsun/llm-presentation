description: Load at the START of new repo work, BEFORE you change any file, so
  you isolate the work in your own workspace/worktree first — and again BEFORE
  any commit, merge, rebase, or publish. Works in any VCS (Jujutsu or Git).
---

# VCS

**Isolate before you edit.** If the prompt gives you an explicit assigned
workspace/worktree path, `cd` there immediately and work in place; that path is
already your isolation, so do **not** create another workspace/worktree. Otherwise,
for any new local work, do not change a single file in the checkout you were
handed. First understand the task well enough to name it `<ide>-<work>` (e.g.
`claude-fix-auth-retry`), then create your own workspace/worktree (§2) and work
there. The one exception: a dedicated cloud/PR session, where you already have
your own clone — then skip isolation.

Then follow this skill for every commit, merge, rebase, and publish too, in
whatever version-control system the repo uses.

## 1. Detect the mode first - before any VCS action

Run `jj root` (or look for a `.jj/` directory).

- **It succeeds -> Jujutsu (jj) mode.** Use jj for everything, **even though Git
  commands also work** — a colocated repo has both `.git` and `.jj`, and a naive
  "is this Git?" check picks the wrong tool. jj is the right tool whenever jj is
  present.
- **It fails / no `.jj` -> Git mode.** Plain Git, including a Git _worktree_ (where
  `.git` is a file pointing into a parent repo). Use Git.

Stay in that mode the whole session and re-confirm it before you publish; never
cross tools (don't run jj in a Git repo, or fall back to raw git in a jj repo).

## 2. For standard flows, run the helper first

Do not spend tokens re-deriving the routine command chain. The bundled helpers
detect the mode and run the standard Git/jj mechanics. Use prose judgment only
when a helper stops for semantic conflict resolution or reports an unexpected
condition.

- **Agent session startup:** local project hooks may run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/session-start.sh --hook <agent> --ide <ide>` before
  you know the task name (`<agent>` is the hook dialect, such as `codex`,
  `claude`, or `agy`). If it prints `NEXT_CWD=...`, `cd` there before edits or
  VCS writes. When the task slug is clear, run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/rename-work.sh <ide>-<work>` from that temporary
  workspace. These helpers record local session ownership outside the tracked
  tree so later guards can reject writes from the shared checkout.
- **Assigned workspace from the user/orchestrator:** if the task gives you an
  explicit workspace/worktree path that is already yours, `cd` there first and
  work in place. Do **not** run `isolate.sh` from the shared checkout and create a
  second workspace; the assigned path is already the isolation.
- **Starting new local work:** from the checkout you were handed, run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/isolate.sh <ide>-<work>`, for example
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/isolate.sh codex-fix-auth-retry`. If it prints
  `NEXT_CWD=...` (it created a fresh workspace/worktree), `cd` there **before you
  edit, read, or run anything else** — every command for this work runs from that
  path, not the checkout you started in. Creating the workspace but staying put
  silently writes into the shared checkout. If instead it prints `CREATED=no` you
  are already isolated; work in place. In a dedicated cloud/PR session you already
  have your own clone; skip isolation.
- **Landing committed work on shared `main`:** run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh <branch-or-bookmark>`, for example
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh agent-2`. If it prints
  `VCS_CONFLICT=...`, resolve only the listed files using the conflict etiquette
  below, then rerun
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh --continue <branch-or-bookmark>`.
  This helper is the standard publish path, not an optional wrapper: raw
  `git push`, `jj bookmark set`, or `jj git push` skip required stale-ref,
  workspace, and `default` cleanup unless the helper explicitly tells you to
  fall back.

`integrate.sh` handles the no-ambiguity finish steps: Git fetch/rebase/push retry,
safe additive Git conflict cleanup for text/JSON files, deterministic
higher-version scalar tie-breaks in config files, jj merge formation, stale
workspace recovery, `main` movement checks, `jj git export`, merged
branch/bookmark deletion when no real remote backs it, parking jj `default` on
`main`, retiring landed jj agent workspaces, and auto-resolving jj conflicts that
are mechanically additive and structurally valid. If it prints `NEXT_CWD=...`,
run any later shell command from that live directory because your jj workspace
was intentionally removed.
In jj mode, `integrate.sh` now also **publishes** `main` to its remote itself
(mirroring git mode) and removes the retired workspace's owner marker, so a clean
run leaves nothing to finish — you are not stranded in the shared `default`. Only
if it reports it could **not** auto-publish (e.g. the remote moved) run exactly
`jj git push --bookmark main` from the live `NEXT_CWD`/`default` workspace as the
fallback. Run it **bare** — that lone push is the one VCS write the guard allows
from the shared checkout; bundling it (`… && jj git push …`) makes the guard
reject it.

Direct file edits, raw VCS writes, and raw publishes may also be guarded by
`vcs-check.sh` through agent hooks. The guard is session-aware: when an agent
runtime omits a tool cwd but the session owns exactly one live, agent-named
workspace/worktree (`claude-*`, `codex-*`, `cursor-*`, `agy-*`, `gemini-*`, ...),
relative shell/file actions are evaluated from that owned workspace instead of
forcing a long `cd <workspace> && ...` prefix on every command. Explicit writes
whose cwd or target is the shared `default`/primary checkout are still refused.
After integration retires the isolated work, use the shared `default`/primary
checkout only when it is clean and parked on `main`.

## 3. Conflict etiquette

When the helper stops for conflicts, the agent's job is semantic resolution:

- Union every additive change. Keep every changelog entry, list/array element,
  and code block that any side added. Do not drop teammates' work.
- For a single-valued field set to different values, keep the higher value.
  Compare values directly; do not rely on "ours" or "theirs" labels.
- Never resolve a whole file with one side (`ours`, `theirs`, `-X ours`).
- Remove every conflict marker: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`, `|||||||`.
- jj conflicts are diff-style. Drop marker/header lines such as `<<<<<<<`,
  `%%%%%%%`, `\\\\\\\`, `+++++++`, and `>>>>>>>`. If a real content line appears
  with a leading marker prefix like `+- streaming export (...)`, keep the content
  line without that extra marker prefix. When `integrate.sh` prints a
  marker-stripped preview, use it to inspect candidates faster, but still verify
  the final file yourself. For purely additive conflicts, you may apply the
  preview with the printed `conflict-preview.py --write ...` command, then inspect
  structured files and adjust any single-valued fields before `--continue`.
- After editing, rerun the helper with `--continue`; do not invent extra
  publish/cleanup commands unless the helper failed.

## 4. Touch only your own work (shared-checkout etiquette)

Several agents may share one machine, or even one checkout. Act only on the work
**you** authored:

- **Commit and publish only your own changes.** Never `jj describe` / `git commit
-a` a shared checkout's whole dirty tree, and never push a commit that bundles
  edits you didn't make. If the working copy holds changes you don't recognize,
  **stop and surface them** — don't sweep them into your commit or take authorship.
  (Isolating first, §2, is what keeps your working copy yours; the helpers reinforce
  it — `integrate.sh` lands only the branch/bookmark you name, never the live tree.)
- **Clean up only what you created.** An unqualified "clean up" means _your own_
  `<ide>-<work>` workspaces/bookmarks. Do not inspect, reason about, or ask about
  another agent's workspace/bookmark — leave it untouched unless the user names it.
  The one thing you may retire that you didn't create is a sibling jj workspace
  whose work has already **landed on `main`** during an integration task (merged
  residue, handled automatically by `integrate.sh`) — never another agent's
  _unmerged_ work.

## 5. Fallback docs and commits

Detailed fallback markdown lives beside this file. Do not read it up front. Open
the matching fallback only if a helper is missing, reports an unexpected setup
problem, or you are authoring/editing a commit message.
